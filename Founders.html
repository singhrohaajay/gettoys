He thinks about many societal issues, such as, science education, health, environment and agricultural issues. He always wanted to do something for the betterment of the society specially by implementing science and technology. He found himself more positive and strong for doing something for society after his USA trip. In USA, he observed that the educated and working people used to organize several charitable programme selflessly for needy people in their society. He realized that it’s our moral responsibility and duty to do something for our society if one is eligible in doing this. Then after, he determined that he would serve his great effort towards the betterment of science education, technology, modern health and agricultural issues in our country. For smooth flow of his determination, he registered the Non-profit/Non-Government Organization, Indian Scientific Education & Technology Foundation (ISET) in Dec 2016 along with his colleague Mr. Shailendra Mishra. This NGO has been working for promotion of science and technology at all possibilities of performance. 
                    </p><p>The mission of ISET Foundation is to improve the quality of science education in India and to ensure that along with theoretical part, children also get equal opportunity to perform scientific practical work in schools. It will be accomplished by working in collaboration with the government, local communities, parents, teachers, volunteers, and civil society members. Organization’s aim is to supplement in science education along with governmental efforts. It is sure, that the foundation will help in achieving the advancement in science education through facilitating the excellent scientific education, various awareness programmes, promoting the innovative ideas, and by endorsing entrepreneurship, to develop competitiveness and stewardship towards science.

C. elegans was the first multi-cellular organism to have it genome mapped and the process of RNAi induced gene silencing was first discovered in this model. Work with C. elegans has resulted in award of Nobel Prize to six scientists for their pioneering work that has significantly aided in understanding of multiple biological processes including understanding of various human disease conditions.</p>
